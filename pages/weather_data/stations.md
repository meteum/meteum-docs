## Weather station data {#stations-data}

The Meteum API allows you to get actual weather indicators from weather stations. To access the data, specify a list of required fields in the GraphQL method `stations`.

The request contains the coordinates of the rectangular area inside which the stations are located. The distance is calculated between the center of this area and the found stations.

The coordinates of the area are passed as parameters of the method:

* `minLat` — minimal latitude;
* `maxLat` — maximum latitude;
* `minLon` — minimal longitude;
* `maxLon` — maximum longitude.

The request will return the indicators of all stations that are located in the area bounded by coordinates:

{% note info %}

Some weather stations may contain a smaller dataset.

{% endnote %}

* `id` — station ID;
* `distance` — the distance between the center of the given area and the found station;
* `name` — the name of the station;
* `time` — the time of receiving the last readings from the station;
* `humidity` — relative humidity;
* `prec` — the amount of precipitation (in millimeters);
* `temperature` — the temperature in the shade at a height of 2 meters from the ground surface.

### Station data for the period {#station-by-period}

To get the station readings for a certain period, use the GraphQL method `stationsByTimeRange`. The request contains the point, in the surrounding area of which the stations are located. The distance is calculated between the coordinates of a given point and the found station near it.

The following parameters are passed to the method:

* `request` — coordinates of the point as a pair of values `lat` (latitude of the point) and `lon` (longitude of the point).
* `timeRange` — a time interval in the form of a pair of values `from` (the beginning of the interval) and `to` (the end of the interval). The values are set in the [Unix-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format.
