## GraphQL API parameters {#parameters}

Using the Meteum API, you can view different parameters of weather data. The available list of parameters depends on your tariff plan.

### datum {#datum}

Datum is a base elevation used as a reference from which to reckon heights or depths of a tide. A tidal datum is a standard elevation defined by a certain phase of the tide. Tidal datums are used as references to measure local water levels and should not be extended into areas having differing oceanographic characteristics without substantiating measurements. In order that they may be recovered when needed, such datums are referenced to fixed points known as bench marks. Tidal datums are also the basis for establishing privately owned land, state owned land, territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, and high seas boundaries.

### condition {#condition}

Represents the general weather conditions.

Tariff plan: all.

### feelslike {#feelslike}

The same temperature can be perceived differently depending on humidity, wind strength and other factors. For example, with a strong wind of -5 Â°, cold is felt, and with high temperature and humidity, heat and heat are felt. Therefore, the forecast displays "feels-like" temperature. It indicates how comfortable the weather conditions are.

{% note info %}

"Feels-like" temperature is calculated as an average for most people. Each person's sense of warmth is individual, so it may differ from the response.
