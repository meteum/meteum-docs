## Available data {#data-types}
The [Meteum technology](https://meteum.ai/meteum_2) uses a large number of different data sources, such as weather radars, weather satellites, weather stations, and even hyperlocal information from users, to determine the current weather at a given point. But despite numerous and varied data sources, there are many places on the planet where information about the current weather is very limited. You should also take into account that most sources don't take measurements/snapshots in real time but rather do it at regular intervals (which usually range from dozens of minutes to hours). At whatever point in time you make a query for the current weather at a particular location, Meteum API will provide the most accurate available data for that location.

Using Meteum API, you can get the following types of data::
- [Actual weather](weather_data/fact.md)
- [Weather forecast](weather_data/forecast.md)
- [Climate data](weather_data/climate.md)
- [Data from weather stations](weather_data/stations.md)
